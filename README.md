# Yelp Dataset Analysis with SQLite

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the final assignment of the "Data Science with SQL" course. In this project, I have used the Yelp dataset to play the role of a real-world data scientist using SQL to both answer specific questions for an organization and make inferences based on my discoveries.

## Dataset Description

The Yelp dataset is a US-based organization that provides a platform for users to provide reviews and rate their interactions with a variety of organizations â€“ businesses, restaurants, health clubs, hospitals, local governmental offices, charitable organizations, etc. Yelp has made a portion of this data available for personal, educational, and academic purposes.

## Project Overview

This project is divided into two parts:

### Part 1: SQL Analysis

In the first part, I have answered a series of questions that help to profile and better understand the data. I have used SQLite to write a variety of SQL statements to answer these questions. The questions and answers are documented, along with the SQL code used to arrive at the answers.

### Part 2: Preparing dataset for business star predictions

In the second part, I have prepared a dataset for a machine learning task, specifically business star rating prediction and provided the sql query I used which you can use on the yelp data to use for yourself. Check it out.
